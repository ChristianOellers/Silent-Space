# Todo

## Priority

### Fixes

- Fix framerate issue on fast systems (game is too fast)
- Fix background size on XXL-large screens (visual trick?)

### Minor

- Increase engine sound slightly
- Add GitHub link (if viewed via Vercel)
- Update background images to be brighter, nebula, interesting
- Add win/lose condition and end screen
  - e.g. be hit max. 3x (lives)

## Refactoring

- Integrate event library

## Future

- Implement Hotkeys for weapons - 1,2
- Implement Mouse click left/right steers like left/right (split screen)
- Fade music from A to B (dramatic sometimes, e.g. 25% chance, never at start)

## Experimental

- Particles: Can multiple items be hacked into?
- Foreground DOM object (display, stereo)
  - Animated by JS, moves/scrolls over screen
  - With SVG mask
  - With Canvas blend-mode OR background-blend
